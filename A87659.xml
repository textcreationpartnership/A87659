            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

Is not this very insolent, daring and presumptuous, so to treat the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? by whose favour they enjoy, what toleration they have, to use their own way of Worship.</p>

                  <hi>Observ. 3.</hi> They know in their Consciences, that this their Libel against me is stuffed full with Lies, as that like <hi>Julian the Apostate,</hi> I once owned the <hi>Apostolick Faith,</hi> but that now I disavow it, or disown it: That mainly for which <hi>Julian</hi> was justly termed an Apostate, was for disowning the Man <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> to be God, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World, and denying that he was to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped

               <p>Note, Whereas several other scurrilous Pamphlets are lately Printed by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and others favouring their wild Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Notions against me, charging me with some passages in my former Books, three Years ago retracted by me [none of which contained their vile Errors, oppugning the fundamentals of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity] I think not at present to take further particular notice of them, it being a mean artifice in them, thus to pull at the <hi>Mote</hi> in my eye, which I have pulled out before them, while the <hi>Beam of</hi> a Body of the vilest Heresies that ever were heard in the World, remains in their own Eyes. For shame let them clear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the things I have proved them guilty of in my <hi>4th.</hi> Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, and in my Book of the <hi>Deisme</hi> of <hi>W. Penn &amp;c.</hi> and other my Books against them before they thus charge me with things that I have retracted in most particulars, and generally in all. But yet further to stop their idle and impertinent clamor, I do by these Presents retract, disown and deny whatever is to be found in any of my Books contrary <hi>to the holy Scriptures, or to the 39 Articles of the Church of</hi> England which I sincerely believe is perfectly accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Doctrine of the holy Scriptures, and also disown, retract and deny al <hi>uncharitable Words,</hi> and Expressions, I have formerly used in any of my former Books, while under the Profession of a <hi>Quaker</hi> against either the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or any of her true Members, or any other true Protestant Church or particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or Persons, Members of any true Protestant Churches. And this I hope will suffice all moderate Persons, for others, I neither can, nor will endeavour to satisfie them, being unreasonable.</p>
